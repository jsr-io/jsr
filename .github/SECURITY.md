# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please follow the Deno Company's
[security policy](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/security/) to report security
vulnerabilities in JSR infrastructure.

You may also report security vulnerabilities in individual packages to the
package's scope owner. If the scope owner is unresponsive, please reach out to
us at [security@jsr.io](mailto:security@jsr.io).
