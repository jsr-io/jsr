description: Learn how to use JSR packages in your projects.

You can use JSR packages in any runtime that supports ES modules, like Deno,
Node, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, etc. You can also use JSR packages with bundlers
that support ES modules, such as **Vite**, **esbuild**, **Webpack**, and
**Rollup**.

## Adding a package

You can add a JSR package to your project using any of the commands below - the
example below will add the most recent version of
[`@luca/flag`](https://jsr.io/@luca/flag) to your project.

```bash
# deno
deno add @luca/flag

# npm (one of the below, depending on your package manager)
npx jsr add @luca/flag
yarn dlx jsr add @luca/flag
pnpm dlx jsr add @luca/flag
bunx jsr add @luca/flag
```

If you're using Deno, the `deno add` command will add an
[import map](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/import_maps) entry for
the JSR module you specified in a `deno.json` file. That entry will look
something like this:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "@luca/flag": "jsr:@luca/flag@^1.0.1"
  }
}
```

For npm and npm-compatible package managers, the `jsr` command will add the
dependency to your `package.json` file, along with a `.npmrc` file to your
project root with the necessary config to use JSR with npm. Learn more about
[JSR's npm compatibility layer](/docs/npm-compatibility).

After installation with `npx jsr add`, your package.json will contain a
dependency entry that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@luca/flag": "npm:@jsr/luca__flag@^1.0.1"
  }
}
```

This npm dependency configuration makes use of a special custom scope called
`@jsr`, which is now configured for you in `.npmrc`:

```
@jsr:registry=https://npm.jsr.io
```

> **NOTE:** You should check the new `.npmrc` file into source control - it will
> be needed to install updates to JSR modules.

Once your package has been added, you can use it in your ES module code the same
way across runtimes:

```ts
import { printProgress } from "@luca/flag";

printProgress();
```

### Importing with `jsr:` specifiers

In Deno, you can use packages without an install step by using `jsr:` specifiers
directly within your source files. In this example, we import the `@luca/flag`
module directly in our code, without needing an import map entry.

```ts
import { printProgress } from "jsr:@luca/flag@^1.0.1";

printProgress();
```

Here the `jsr:` specifier is followed by the package scope, the package name, a
[semver constraint](#semver-resolution), and optionally an entrypoint.

## Semver resolution

JSR uses semantic versioning to resolve package versions. This means that you
can use a semver range in your `jsr:` specifier, import map, or `package.json`
`"dependencies"` entry, and then the runtime or package manager will download
the latest version that satisfies all constraints for the package.

If you only care about the major version, you can specify just the major
version:

```bash
# deno
deno add @luca/flag@1

# npm (and npm-like systems)
npx jsr add @luca/flag@1
```

If you want to use a specific minor version, you can specify the minor version:

```bash
# deno
deno add @luca/flag@1.0

# npm (and npm-like systems)
npx jsr add @luca/flag@1.0
```

If you want to use a specific patch version, you can specify the patch version:

```bash
# deno
deno add @luca/flag@1.0.1

# npm (and npm-like systems)
npx jsr add @luca/flag@1.0.1
```

If you want to use at least a specific patch version, but do want to allow\
updates, you can specify the patch version with a `^` prefix:

```bash
# deno
deno add @luca/flag@^1.0.1

# npm (and npm-like systems)
npx jsr add @luca/flag@^1.0.1
```

## Entrypoints

Every package on JSR has one or more entrypoints. An entrypoint is a module that
can be imported by users of the package. The entrypoint is specified in the
`exports` field of the package's config file.
[Learn more about `exports`](/docs/publishing-packages#package-metadata).

If you don't specify an entrypoint in your import, the runtime will use the
package's default entrypoint. For example, when you import `jsr:@luca/flag@1`,
you import the default entrypoint of the `@luca/flag` package.

You can also import other entrypoints from a package. To do this, specify the
entrypoint after the version constraint:

```ts
import { join } from "jsr:@std/path@1/join";
```

If you're using an import map, or a `package.json`, you can specify the
entrypoint after the alias:

```ts
import { join } from "@std/path/join";
```

Files not listed in the `exports` field are not directly importable by users of
the package. However, they can be imported by other modules in the package.

Packages are not required to have a default entrypoint. If a package does not
have a default entrypoint, then you must specify an entrypoint in your import.
