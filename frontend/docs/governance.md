JSR is for the community and has an open governance model. Here are ways you can
get involved with the JSR project.

## Open Working Group Meetings

JSR holds open working group meetings every two weeks on Fridays
([view the public calendar](https://deno.co/jsr-meeting)).

[View video recordings of previous meetings here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nkV3s4SQP2-lQdy---0oHwHSVCjzhJlR).

## Community Moderators

We're currently looking to establish a moderation group to oversee and evolve
JSR policy. This will be established after the governance board begins working.

[Apply to become a moderator here](https://jsr.io/go/moderator).
