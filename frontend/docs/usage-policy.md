description: This document describes the usage policy for JSR.
---

_Last updated: Feb 27th, 2024_

JSR is a public registry service for the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem. It
is designed to be a reliable and secure place to publish and discover packages.
To ensure that JSR remains a reliable and secure place for everyone, we have a
usage policy that all users must follow to use the service.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to JSR for any account that
violates this usage policy.

## Acceptable use

JSR may only be used to publish and consume packages that consist of source code
destined to be executed in a runtime that supports JavaScript or TypeScript.

It is acceptable to serve package contents directly to browsers for development
purposes.

It is acceptable to publish tooling that is designed to analyze or identify
malware.

## Unacceptable use

Packages must not grossly misrepresent their purpose or functionality to deceive
users. This includes, but is not limited to, packages that are designed to
collect user data without consent, to perform malicious actions, to impersonate
other packages, or to violate the privacy or security of users.

Malware, adware, or any other software that is designed to harm users or their
devices is not allowed on JSR.

It is not acceptable to use JSR as a CDN for serving assets directly to web
applications in a browser, except for development purposes. JSR is not a general
purpose file hosting service.

JSR may not be used to distribute images, videos, or other documents that are
not directly related to JavaScript or TypeScript packages.

Content that is considered illegal based on the laws of the United States of
America is not permitted on JSR.

## Examples

- You MAY use JSR to publish a package that provides a JavaScript library for
  performing calculations.
- You MAY use JSR to publish a package that provides a TypeScript library for
  working with dates.
- You MAY use JSR to publish a package that contains SVG icons that are used by
  a JavaScript library.
- You MAY include a PNG image of the package logo in the package, to display it
  in the package README.
- You MAY NOT use JSR to publish a package that contains an MP4 file of a movie.
- You MAY NOT use JSR to publish a package that contains many pictures of cats.
- You MAY NOT use JSR to publish a package that scrapes the /etc/passwd file
  from the user's system and uploads it to a remote server, unless this is the
  intended purpose of the package and this is made clear to the user.
- You MAY NOT use JSR to publish a package that contains a virus.
- You MAY use JSR to publish a package that contains a tool for analyzing
  malware, as long as the tool is not itself malware.

## Reporting violations

If you believe that a package on JSR violates this usage policy, please
[contact us](mailto:report@jsr.io).

## Changes to this policy

We may change this usage policy at any time. We will notify users of any changes
to this policy by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
We encourage users to review this policy regularly to stay informed about
acceptable usage of JSR.
